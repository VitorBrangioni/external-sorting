# external-sorting
class of sorting algorithms that can handle massive amounts of data. External sorting is required when the data being sorted do not fit into the main memory of a computing device (usually RAM) and instead they must reside in the slower external memory, usually a hard disk drive. Thus, external sorting algorithms are external memory algorithms and thus applicable in the external memory model of computation.
